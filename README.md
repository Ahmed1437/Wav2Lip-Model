# Lip Syncing with Wav2Lip Model

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the Wav2Lip model to synchronize audio with video, achieving high-quality lip-syncing results. The model takes an input video and an audio file and generates a video where the lip movements of the speaker match the provided audio. This project can be used for various applications, including dubbing, video editing, and content creation.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Uses the Wav2Lip model, which is known for its accuracy in lip-syncing tasks.
- **Custom Audio Input**: Supports custom audio inputs, allowing you to lip-sync any audio to a video.
- **Flexible Output**: Generates videos in various formats based on user requirements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Git

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lip-sync-wav2lip.git
   cd lip-sync-wav2lip
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use \`venv\Scripts\activate\`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pretrained Models**

   Download the pretrained Wav2Lip model weights and place them in the appropriate directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir models
   wget -O models/wav2lip.pth https://path-to-pretrained-model
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Model

To run the lip-syncing model, use the following command:

```bash
python lipsync.py --input_video path/to/video.mp4 --input_audio path/to/audio.wav --output_video path/to/output.mp4
```

### Example

```bash
python lipsync.py --input_video sample_video.mp4 --input_audio sample_audio.wav --output_video output_video.mp4
```

This command will produce a video file (\`output_video.mp4\`) where the lips of the person in the video are synchronized with the provided audio.

### Jupyter Notebook

You can also explore the model using the provided Jupyter notebook:

1. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Wav2Lip_lipsync_model.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the video and audio, run the model, and visualize the results.
